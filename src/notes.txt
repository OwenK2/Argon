THINGS TO DO / REMEMBER
	- notification and probably prompt too sometimes randomly seg fault
	- argon drawable put image data



PLAN FOR NEW ARGON
	- Create an argon shape class where the user can
	create a shape and add features to it
	like so

	Argon_Shape shape(h,w);
	shape.addLine(x,y,x,y);
	shape.render();

	and uses textures that way the user can efficently store
	the shape class
